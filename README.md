# gutural_nlp
The objective of this project is to leverage the Whisper state of the art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI for automatic speech recognition of gutural and scream sounds mainly present in heavy metal music.

I take advantage of the HuggingFace ecosystem to fine-tune a large version of the Whisper model on music dataset curated manually by me.
