## Scream: Fine-Tuned Whisper model for automatic gutural speech recognition ü§üü§üü§ü
The objective of this project is to leverage the Whisper state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI for automatic speech recognition of gutural and scream sounds mainly present in heavy metal music.

I take advantage of the HuggingFace ecosystem to:

**1)** Create a dataset using .srt files and audio .wav files collected from Youtube in order to annotate vocal sound extracts.

**2)** Fine-tune a large version of the Whisper model on the dataset created.

**3)** Deploy a demo on Space repository using Gradio.

* [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jpdiazpardo/guturalScream_metalVocals)
  
Speech-to-text dataset with +2.5h of annotated audio, comprised of clean vocals and different gutural sounds, including: low, mid, & high fry screams. The data was built with an eclectic sample of artists from varied sub-genres of hard metal music. Some of the artists included are: Suicide Silence, Lamb of God, Cradle of Filth, Cannibal Corpse and much more (full YouTube playlist available below).

Live demo of the ASR engine. With the transcription, I analyze the emotions present in the lyrics to identify: anger ü§¨, disgust ü§¢, fear üò®, joy üòÄ, neutral üòê, sadness üò≠, surprise üò≤ in a user friendly and interactive spider chart.
