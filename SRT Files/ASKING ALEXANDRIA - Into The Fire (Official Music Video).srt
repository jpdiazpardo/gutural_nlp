1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,700
Take them all back

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,200
Take them all back

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,150
Take them all back

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,800
I'm not too sure what I'm
supposed to do with this

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,300
These hands, this mind,
this instability

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,700
From a cage I created, to
a hell that heaven made

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,100
Can't let go of the hatred, 'cause
I love the way it tastes

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,800
Take them all back

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,200
I wouldn't take back a moment

10
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,600
Not one miserable moment

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,500
I'll give it all, 'til there's nothing

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,700
I'd walk into the fire

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,550
Into the fire

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,600
I'd walk into the fire

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,200
Into the fire

16
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,800
Into the fire

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,200
I've come to terms with the
fact I'll never change

18
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,600
And that's just fine, I find
solace in the pain

19
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't mind the darkness,
it's easy on the eyes

20
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm praying for something
to make me feel alive

21
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,800
I wouldn't take back a moment

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Not one miserable moment

23
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll give it all, 'til there's nothing

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,900
I'd walk into the fire

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Into the fire

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,900
I'd walk into the fire

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Into the fire

28
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,200
Into the fire

29
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm a paranoid, sycophant,
masochistic dilettante

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,200
Narcissistic elephant in the room

31
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm the end of the world,
thinning the herd

32
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,600
The all around outta my
mind, fucking absurd

33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:15,900
I am gone, I am gone

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,300
I wouldn't take back a moment

35
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,250
I'd walk into the fire

36
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,150
Into the fire

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,200
I'd walk into the fire

38
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,800
Into the fire

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,400
Into the fire

40
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,900
Fire

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Take them all back

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:04,800
