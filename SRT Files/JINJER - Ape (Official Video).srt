1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,800
The beginning of all beginnings

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,100
The era of nonexistence

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,400
When the Earth wasn't the Earth

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,550
When our planet was a fireball

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,700
It was raining heavily
for a thousand years

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,100
And the fireball became an ocean

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,400
That cooking water, the primal soup

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,000
A natural life-giving potion

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,700
This substance strove to find a way

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,700
To create another form of miracle

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,100
I brought a myriad atoms and
turn them into your flesh

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,300
Regenerated through destruction
and chaos

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,600
While the young world
was sculpting itself

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,700
No one could notice how you
stroke a different pose

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Voracious ape who walks upright

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,100
Who deserts life to satisfy
his appetite

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,400
Don't you remember you were
the size of a bean?

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,400
Now what a shame to wear the
name of a 'human being'

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:24,800
Oh, here you are! Vertically standing!

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,600
He, who calls himself intelligent

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,000
But has not much for understanding

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,200
Oh, here you go, Mr. Know-it-all!

23
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:44,800
I made a mistake when I created
you long time ago

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,100
Oh, here you go

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,800
Oh, here you go

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:11,100
Oh, here you go

27
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:31,150
Just the mention of your name

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,700
Would make the whole world
start to shake

29
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,600
Who gave you right to save your life

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,600
By taking life from others?

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,800
By taking life away!

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
By taking life away!

33
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,500
By taking life away!

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Bloodthirsty ape who walks upright

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,000
What shall I do to humble
your appetite?

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,200
Bloodthirsty ape who walks upright

37
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,100
What shall I do to humble
your appetite?

38
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:30,100
