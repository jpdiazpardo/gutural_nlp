1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,200
I felt you dragging me
into a shallow grave

2
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,600
The dirt became a place to
rest, but it betrays

3
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,100
You'll never stop me,
your reign has ended

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,100
You'll never hold down that
which has ascended

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,600
I won't run, I won't turn away

6
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,600
I won't let you get the best of me

7
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,600
I won't fall in your gravity

8
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,450
Open your eyes

9
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,400
You're the earth and I'm the sky

10
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,900
You are the single stone
amongst infinity

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,400
I am the wind that blows, I am
the voice inside the rain

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,500
Can you feel the cold wind blowing

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Unrelenting, everlasting?

14
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,700
Do you feel it in your bones?

15
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,700
Do you feel it in your soul?

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,500
I won't run, I won't turn away

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,500
I won't let you get the best of me

18
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I won't fall in your gravity

19
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Open your eyes

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I won't run (run), I won't turn away

21
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,800
I won't let you get the best of me

22
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,900
I won't fall (fall) in your gravity

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Open your eyes

24
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,500
You're the earth and I'm the sky

25
