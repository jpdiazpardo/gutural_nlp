1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,600
If I can't let you go will
darkness divide?

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,500
For the fiction of love is
the truth of our lies

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,200
We were playing for keeps but
we both knew the cost

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,100
Now the only way out’s in
your heart shaped box

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,100
But I hate that it seemed
you were never enough

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,000
We were broken and bleeding
but never gave up

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,800
And I hate that I made you the enemy

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,200
And I hate that your heart
was the casualty

9
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,100
Now I hate that I need you

10
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,500
As we rest here alone
like notes on a page

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,600
The finest to compose could
not play our pain

12
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,800
With a candle through time I
could still see your ghost

13
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,300
But I can't close my eyes, for it

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,000
For it is there where you haunt
me most (Haunt me most)

15
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,300
Where you haunt me most

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,200
I hate that it seemed you
were never enough

17
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,100
We were broken and bleeding
but never gave up

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,900
And I hope that I sing
through your memory

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
As we echo through time in the melody

20
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,450
Now I hate that I need you

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,300
And I hear you now when
you said it hurt

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,400
But it had to fall, fall apart to work

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,200
As I see you now in what's left of me

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Is it too late to plead insanity?

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,200
I won’t let go

26
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,500
'Cause I hate that it seemed
you were never enough

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,400
You were broken and bleeding
in the name of love

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,400
And I hope that we meet
in another life

29
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,400
I hope that we meet in another life

30
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I don't hate that I need you

31
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,100
I don't hate that I need you

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,600
I don't hate that I need you

33
