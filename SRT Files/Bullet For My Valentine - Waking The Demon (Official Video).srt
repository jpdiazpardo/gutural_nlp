00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,050
Helpless, my eyes are bleeding
from the fear that's inside,

2
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,200
You sealed your demise when
you took what was mine

3
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,400
Don't try and stop me from
avenging this world,

4
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,600
No voice to be heard

5
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,300
Waking the Demon,

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Where'd ya run to

7
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,000
Walking in shadows,

8
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,800
Watch the blood flow

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,400
There's not much longer so
don't try and fight,

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,100
Your body's weakening
so walk to the light

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,400
All those painful times
so alone so ashamed,

12
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,300
I'm not coming back there's
nothing to gain

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,800
Caution, there's just no limits
to the boundaries you push,

14
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,900
I've warned you but still you
just fuck with my mind

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,400
There's no escape from this
rage that I feel,

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,400
Nothing is real

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,100
Waking the Demon,

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Where'd ya run to

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,600
Walking in shadows,

20
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,800
Watch the blood flow

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,200
There's not much longer so
don't try and fight,

22
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,900
Your body's weakening
so walk to the light

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,200
All those painful times
so alone so ashamed,

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,200
I'm not coming back there's
nothing to gain

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,300
Breath for me,

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,300
Don't wake me from this slumber

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,700
Stay with me,

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Possession taking over

29
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,900
Breath for me,

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,900
Don't wake me from this slumber

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Stay with me,

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,700
