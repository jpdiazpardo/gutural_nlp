0 - OK
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Tell me was it all worth it,
to watch your kingdom grow?

1 - OK
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,800
Sunk this low

2 - OK
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,800
Now we're gone, left without a trace

3 - OK
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,000
But we took something
they cannot replace

4 - OK
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,800
A match made in heaven,
paved the road to hell

5 - OK
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,400
We've been down this path before

6 - OK
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,900
Cold blooded retribution,
So fuck your revolution

7 - OK
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,600
You chew up peace and
spit it out as war

8 - OK
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,600
You've been feeding the wolf
that's waiting at the door

9 - OK
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,700
You are rotten to the core

10 - OK
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,300
Found your fingerprints
all over the trigger

11 - OK  
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,600
If you're looking for tyrants,
take a look in the mirror

12 - OK
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,500
You knew all along, that
the cancer would spread

13 - OK
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,200
Don't be surprised to find
a price on your head,
sorry son, but we destroyed your home

14 - OK
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,300
We murdered your family,
now you're on your own

15 - OK
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,000
Collateral damage, face
down in the sand

16 - OK
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,200
Watch the dominoes fall, it's
all just part of the plan

17 - OK
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,100
A match made in heaven,
paved the road to hell

18 - OK
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:42,000
We've been down this path before,
Cold blooded retribution,
So fuck your revolution

19 - OK
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:50,300
A match made in heaven,
Paved the road to hell,
We've been down this path before

20 - OK
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,400
And every execution, the
price of your collusion

21 - OK
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,600
along, that the cancer would spread

22 - OK
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,700
So don't be surprised to find
a price on your head

23 - OK
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Tell me was it all worth it,
to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean
haven't sunk this low

24 - OK
00:03:48,200 --> 00:04:03,600
are rotten to the core,
You are rotten to the core,
You are rotten to the core,
You are rotten to the core
