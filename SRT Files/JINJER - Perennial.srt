1 - OK
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,100
This autumn feels like funeral to me

2 - OK
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,400
And not for what has passed

3 - OK
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,200
But for what shall last

4 - OK
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,600
Exhausted nature is so
tragic and suicidal

5 - OK
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,500
Oh how spectacular she is
when she kills herself

6 - OK
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:17,300
Death throes are slowly
crawling to her toes, as the last leaf is falling off her head

7 - OK
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm here with her undressed

8 - OK
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:35,800
With a few petals on my breasts

9 - OK
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,300
We shared opiates and let the
landscapes do the same

10 - OK
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:49,300
I love your warmth but yet prefer
to sleep in cold alone. We fixed our eyes up to the sky

11 - OK
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,500
To see a flight send us farewell

12 - OK
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,350
Goodbye

13 - OK
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:17,400
May we see each other next time.
So please, come back to celebrate
this festival of life then as now fly

14 - OK
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:26,100
Today you reached the
point of no return. Now cry and then die

15 - OK
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Tomorrow I will meet you with
your cells restored

16 - OK
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:59,300
Annual tradition of mass destruction

17 - OK
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:09,000
In the name of total reconstruction

18 - OK
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,900
My biggest source of confusion

19 - OK
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,100
The reason of decay and disillusion

20 - OK
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,100
Under permanent ice

21 - OK
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,850
We found a breathless paradise

22 - OK
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,800
No, we're not dead

23 - OK
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,300
No, we're not dead

24 - OK
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:47,300
Just enjoying coma

25 - OK
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,100
From the ashes of my roots

26 - OK
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,700
The new me will rise to live again

27 - OK
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,600
This is poetry of youth

28 - OK
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,200
This is poetry of me and you

29 - OK
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,600
From the ashes of my roots

30 - OK
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,500
The new me will rise to live again

31 - OK
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,700
This is poetry of youth

32 - OK
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,000
This is poetry of me and you
