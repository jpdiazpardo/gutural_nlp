1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,850
Incite a riot, put yourself
in a trance

2
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,900
You rotate the frame in
a world you rely on

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,300
A scar, a line has been
drawn in the sand

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,200
Behold the life, the boundaries
fools will crush

5
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,300
The greatest miracle

6
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,100
Is burning to the ground

7
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,500
Onto the next stage of the plan

8
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,100
Mourn the witness of the wind

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,900
A handful of thunder

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,300
Will rise one last time

11
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,600
There's fire in the sky

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,700
You're in the Amazon

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,700
The greatest miracle

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,000
Is burning to the ground

15
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,600
Godly Amazonia

16
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,200
Bloody Amazonia

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,800
Mighty Amazonia

18
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,500
Killing Amazonia

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,000
Godly Amazonia

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,600
Bloody Amazonia

21
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,200
Mighty Amazonia

22
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,000
Killing Amazonia

23
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,500
Godly Amazonia

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,000
Bloody Amazonia

25
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,700
Burn

26
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,200
The land

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Learn

28
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,700
The end

29
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
Burn

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,700
Another gold mine is unveiled

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
The source of our sorrow

32
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,600
Learn

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,700
Embedded in these walls of green

34
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,900
Is the curse that we follow

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
There's fire in the sky

36
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,200
You're in the Amazon

37
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,500
The greatest miracle

38
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Is burning to the ground

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
