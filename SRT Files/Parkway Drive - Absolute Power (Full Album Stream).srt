1
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,700
Your heart, your home, your voice,
it's got a price tag

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,600
Sign in blood, bury your
rights in a body bag

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
They're feeding fear through
the fault lines

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,850
You heard it here first, they got
your freedoms on the front line

5
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,800
Prime time, the noose at our throats

6
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,000
Our liberties hands run with
blood of the scapegoats

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,200
So tell me, how can we demonize

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,700
When we can't see life through
another's eyes

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,900
Pay 'em off and play 'em off

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,700
Fear rolls like a reaper through
the streets of the lost

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,000
Pay 'em off and play 'em off

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,300
But in the eyes of the storm

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,200
The truth drops like a bomb

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,300
The truth drops like a bomb

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,700
The battle is on

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,100
Hands in chains for a
fist full of dollars

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Who do we blame for the
holes in our knowledge

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,900
The past you know has been
written by the victor

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
So I ask you now, who is
it writing your future

20
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,300
The butcher, the liar, the
thief or the killer

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,300
Your freedom died quiet
in the halls of power

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,600
Starved for peace we'll eat
war until it kills us

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,550
Six feet deep with a belly
full of bullets

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Pay 'em off and play 'em off

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,300
Fear rolls like a reaper through
the streets of the lost

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,600
Pay 'em off and play 'em off

27
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,700
But in the eyes of the storm

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,200
The truth drops like a bomb

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,600
The truth drops like a bomb

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,600
The battle is on

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,700
The hate runs deep but
our hopes cut deeper

32
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,700
Now we walk through the valley
in the shadow of the reaper

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,700
Money talks, and it's
speaking in tongues

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,700
They put a price on our soul,
like they had already won

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,300
Now open wide

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,200
I see their jaws locked tight

37
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,300
Silent in the moment, like
prey in the floodlights

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,300
The signal is static, baptised in fire

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,600
Now we see how they talk

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,800
With a mouth full of barbed wire

41
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,100
Absolute power

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Absolute power

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,500
Absolute power

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,150
Absolute power corrupts absolutely

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Absolute power

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,400
Absolute power

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,600
Absolute power

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,300
Absolute power corrupts

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,700
The truth drops like a bomb

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,700
The truth drops like a bomb

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,350
The battle is on

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,100
The truth drops like a'

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,800
Absolute power corrupts absolutely

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:48,800
