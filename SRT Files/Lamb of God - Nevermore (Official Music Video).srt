1
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,500
Driving down blistered severe

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,000
The rapacious maw of our despair

3
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,500
Black dog follows, strip club echoes

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,800
The raven's shadow across the ghetto

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,300
Up the hill in an unmarked grave

6
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
The mother of American darkness lays

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,700
Liberty or death to start the battle

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:14,300
There's nonesuch place
for human chattel

9
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Hanging by a threat

10
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,050
Now you can choke on it

11
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,100
Hanging by a threat

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,100
So go and choke on it

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
This is a reckoning

14
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,150
You hear the raven's scream

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,600
Hanging by a threat

16
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,000
So go and choke on it

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,100
Across the devil's own half acrе

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,800
There's rusted gallows for an angеl

19
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,100
The ghosts that built this city scream

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,400
Of commerce and inhumanity

21
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,300
Cancer rides the freeway's edge

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,900
Falling statues and cigarettes

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,700
Bullets whip the screaming kettle

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,900
As tear gas cloaks the monumental

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,400
Hanging by a threat

26
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,300
Now you can choke on it

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,500
Hanging by a threat

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,700
So go and choke on it

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,000
This is a reckoning

30
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
You hear the raven's scream

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,500
Hanging by a threat

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,100
So go and choke on it

33
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,500
Chained beneath a parking lot

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,700
Savaged on the auction block

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,900
In antebellum geography

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,300
Rage, horror, history

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Hanging by a threat

38
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,450
Now you can choke on it

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,200
Hanging by a threat

40
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,300
So go and choke on it

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
This is a reckoning

42
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
You hear the raven's scream

43
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,300
Hanging by a threat

44
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,100
So go and choke on it

45
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,800
Nevermore

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,600
Nevermore
