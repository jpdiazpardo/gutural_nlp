1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,700
Burn it down, brick by
brick. Made in 2006

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,600
Lost and found, losing
grip, I needed this

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,200
Question me not, for I
gave up everything.

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,100
Forget me not, cause I've not
forgotten what this means.

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,850
Strip me down, tear me apart,
you'll find one theme left.

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,100
No sign of stopping till
my veins rust.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,150
Strip me down, Tear me apart,
you'll find one thing left.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,800
I fucking know where I came from.

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,950
And nothing can replace
those lessons learned,

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,600
As I stood with my brothers
on the side of the road.

11
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,000
No longer haunted by the skeletons.

12
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,300
No longer haunted by the past.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,700
For so long, it's all I've known

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm crossing over the undertow.

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,000
For so long no one was listening

16
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:41,100
Determined to make their
deaf ears ring.

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,100
Miles repeat. My worst enemy... is me.

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,900
But then 4 soon became 6

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,950
To shatter the canvas

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Handed nothing. Loss
pulling the strings

21
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,400
Outlived the dead trends

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,100
United by distance

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,300
For so long, it's all I've known

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,500
I'm crossing over the undertow.

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,500
For so long no one was listening

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:28,900
Determined to make their
deaf ears ring.

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,000
I've been to hell and back,
with no promise of return.

28
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,300
So I made friends with fire, to
keep from getting burned.

29
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,500
No money, no sleep. Dedication

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,700
10 years on the road this is sacred.

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,000
And when I'm facing a
wall, I do not quit.

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,800
...Cause if you mean it,
you will make it.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,400
Pulled apart in a world so demanding.

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,900
I'm still here, still standing

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,300
I've sweat blood from Stockholm
to Scranton

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,100
Still here, still standing.

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,000
You can always rinse the surface,

38
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,900
but the stain will remain.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
For so long, it's all I've known

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm crossing over the undertow.

41
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,100
For so long no one was listening

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,000
I did my time.

43
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,900
You live, you learn,
you defy the terms,

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,400
but this house will be my home.

45
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,400
Beguiled, betrayed, it's
the price we pay,

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,500
as trust will be our tomb.

47
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,300
If you mean it, you'll make it

48
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:38,300
