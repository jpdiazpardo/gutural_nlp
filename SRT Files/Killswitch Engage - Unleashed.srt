1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:36,500
Deceive me, release me, unleash me

2
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:44,900
You've unleashed the wild within

3
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,600
Welcome to the madness

4
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,200
That dwells inside these eyes

5
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,600
Pushed unto the breaking point

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,450
You're running out of time

7
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,100
This innocent blood is on your hands

8
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,300
Deceive me

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,700
Come face to face with the final stand

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,500
Release me

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,000
It's the part of me you
can't comprehend

12
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,800
Unleash me

13
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:44,900
You've unleashed the wild within

14
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,300
The wild within

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,700
You who spoke defiance

16
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,650
You who spoke in jest

17
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,800
The last of all my tolerance

18
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,700
Has left this broken man

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,000
This innocent blood is on your hands

20
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,500
Deceive me

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,700
Come face to face with the final stand

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Release me

23
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,000
It's the part of me you
can't comprehend

24
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,000
Unleash me

25
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:44,400
You've unleashed the wild within

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,400
I remind you time and time again

27
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,200
You've broken the restrains
against your heart

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,400
Against the dark

29
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,300
Can you feel the pain of
those you've betrayed

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,700
The promises unmade, broken hearts
that fill with shame

31
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
And you're to blame

32
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,600
Do they call your name

33
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:44,000
There's nothing left to say,
nothing left to say

34
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,100
This innocent blood is on your hands

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,300
Deceive me

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,800
Come face to face with the final stand

37
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,000
Release me

38
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,000
It's the part of me you
can't comprehend

39
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,700
Unleash me

40
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:17,500
You've unleashed the wild within

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:27,500
