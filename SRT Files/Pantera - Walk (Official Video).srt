1
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,050
Can't you see? I'm easily
bothered by persistence

2
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,100
One step from lashing out at you

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,200
You want in to get under my skin
and call yourself a friend

4
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,700
I've got more friends like
you, what do I do?

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,500
Is there no standard anymore?

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,500
What it takes, who I am,
where I've been, belong

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,400
You can't be something you're not

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,700
Be yourself by yourself,
stay away from me

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,500
A lesson learned in life, known
from the dawn of time

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:25,000
Respect, walk, what did you say?

11
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:33,000
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?

12
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,000
Are you talking to me?

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,350
Rock your mouth when I'm not around,
it's easy to achieve

14
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,000
You cry to weak friends
that sympathize

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,700
Can you hear the violins
playing your song?

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,700
Those same friends tell
me your every word

17
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,700
Is there no standard anymore?

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,600
What it takes, who I am,
where I've been, belong

19
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,600
You can't be something you're not

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,700
Be yourself by yourself,
stay away from me

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,900
A lesson learned in life, known
from the dawn of time

22
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,800
Respect, walk, what did you say?

23
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:41,100
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,400
Respect, walk, what did you say?

25
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:56,100
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,700
Are you talking to me? No way punk

27
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:52,150
Respect, walk, what did you say?

28
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:00,150
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?

29
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:08,050
Respect, walk, what did you say?

30
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?

31
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,000
Are you talking to me?
Walk on home boy
