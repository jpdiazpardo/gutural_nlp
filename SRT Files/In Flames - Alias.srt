0
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,000
The serpent knows

1
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,100
When the curtain falls

2
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,000
With denials blindfold

3
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,500
He greets another day

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,200
Don't believe the mask

5
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,100
It adapts to any lie

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
A perfect ten

7
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,500
When reality caves in

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't tell me

9
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,900
Tell my ghost

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,700
'Cause I blame him for all
I don't want to know

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:30,900
I found secrets about life's undertow

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Life's wrapped in a riddle

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,300
Easier said than done

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,900
Hate to play the victim

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,500
Rather run and hide

16
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Don't believe the mask

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,600
It adapts to any lie

18
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,700
A perfect ten

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,400
When reality caves in

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,200
Don't tell me

21
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,200
Tell my ghost

22
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:21,700
'Cause I blame him for all
I don't want to know

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,700
I found secrets about life's undertow

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:03:18,300
Let them take me far away

25
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Crawl back in place

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,300
It's easier to cope behind the curtain

27
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,800
Wipe the worries away

28
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:50,200
No thought about the consequence

29
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't believe the mask

30
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,100
It adapts to any lie

31
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,800
A perfect ten

32
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,800
When reality caves in

33
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,400
Don't tell me

34
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Tell my ghost

35
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:23,000
'Cause I blame him for all
I don't want to know

36
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:30,200
I found secrets about life's undertow

37
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:39,000
Let them take me far away
