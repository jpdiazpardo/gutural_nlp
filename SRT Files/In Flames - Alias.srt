0 - OK
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,800
The serpent knows when the curtain falls

1 - OK
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:49,200
With denials blindfold he greets another day.
Don't believe the mask

2 - OK
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,100
It adapts to any lie

3 - OK
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:02,500 
A perfect ten when reality caves in. 
Don't tell me

4 - OK
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,000
Tell my ghost

5 - OK
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,700
'Cause I blame him for all
I don't want to know

6 - OK
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:26,900
I found secrets about life's undertow

7 - OK
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,300
Life's wrapped in a riddle easier said than done

8 - OK
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,900
Hate to play the victim

9 - OK
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's run and hide.
Don't believe the mask, it adapts to any lie

10 - OK
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A perfect ten

11 - OK
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
When reality caves in.
Don't tell me

12 - OK
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,200
Tell my ghost

13 - OK
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:17,700
'Cause I blame him for all
I don't want to know

14 - OK
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,000
I found secrets about life's undertow

15 - OK
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,700
Let them take me far away

16 - OK
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Crawl back in place

17 - OK
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,300
It's easier to cope behind the curtain

18 - OK
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,800
Wipe the worries away

19 - OK
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,000
No thought about the consequence

20 - OK
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,100
Don't believe the mask.
It adapts to any lie

21 - OK
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,000
A perfect ten

22 - OK
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,500
When reality caves in.
Don't tell me

23 - OK
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Tell my ghost

24 - OK
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:19,500
'Cause I blame him for all
I don't want to know

25 - OK
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:29,600
I found secrets about life's undertow

26 - OK
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:38,000
Let them take me far away
