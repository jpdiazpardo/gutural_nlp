1
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,800
You were told to swallow,
crawl and hide

2
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,800
Victims of fear and deception

3
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Get ahold of yourself, rise above

4
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,800
The better part of you, immortal

5
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,800
May this purple spring
flow into your soul

6
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,800
Exhausting all these
black holes inside

7
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,100
Wake up to the sound of doom!

8
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:10,000
Let this chant ring in your
bones and lift you up

9
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,600
Get strong

10
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,800
Get strong

11
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,300
Get strong

12
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,800
Get strong

13
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,900
Leave the mud behind and
climb up the sky

14
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,900
Wake up to the sound of doom!

15
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,500
Leave the mud behind and
climb up the sky

16
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,900
Wake up, wake up

17
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,300
Leave the mud behind and
climb up the sky

18
