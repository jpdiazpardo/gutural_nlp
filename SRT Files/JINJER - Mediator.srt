0 - OK
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,600
Stop!

1 - OK
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Go!

2 - OK
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Go on!

3 - OK
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,600
My wish would be

4 - OK
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,000
To see this sun shining

5 - OK
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,000
To hear these birds singing

6 - OK
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,100
Children laughing, hearts recovering

7 - OK
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,700
My dream has always been

8 - OK
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,400
Life has always seemed

9 - OK
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,400
To be an amusement park

10 - OK
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,200
Rather colourful than dark.
I wanted a loser to win

11 - OK
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,250
The thin never starving

12 - OK
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,500
The full not keeping it down

13 - OK
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,700
And needing nothing from no one

14 - OK
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,300
I wanted the poor to live in abundance

15 - OK
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,100
I wanted the rich to have someone

16 - OK
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,500
Except for himself

17 - OK
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,750
To love and take care of.
I wanted a loser to win

18 - OK
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,950
The thin never starving

19 - OK
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,400
The full not keeping it down and needing nothing from now on

20 - OK
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,700
Fires burning all around us

21 - OK
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,800
And all we feel is cold

22 - OK
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
I want a neighbour not a hater

23 - OK
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,100
And a head to go round

24 - OK
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,200
From white white snow

25 - OK
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,850
But what to do now?

26 - OK
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,250
Wish I could catch god by the beard

27 - OK
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,000
And drag him to the dirty streets

28 - OK
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
To show him what was going on

29 - OK
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,100
The kind of curse we've waged upon

30 - OK
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,800
We're half way through to freedom

31 - OK
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,800
The path is treacherous

32  - OK
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,200
The best way to make a kettle boil

33 - OK
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,550
Is to turn your back on this

34 - OK
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,100
You've stranded me with no decree

35 - OK
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,800
No lessons given, only learned

36 - OK
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,900
Cold blood is coursing
through my veins

37 - OK
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,300
Cause ice will never burn

38 - OK
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,000
What is happiness?

39 - OK
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,200
What is inner peace?

40 - OK
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,800
What do we have to do

41 - OK
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,700
To get a piece of you?
