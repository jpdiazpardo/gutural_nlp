1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Read all about it if you want to know

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Read all about what they
want you to know

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,200
Everything is god online, and
it's as evil as it gets

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,700
This is not a fuckin' trick, either
follow or repent (No choice)

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,200
Get infected by a vertical event

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
Check the meter, check your watch

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,900
Are they ever gonna stop?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,200
Runnin' out of daylight,
nighttime's better

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,500
But we know how to handle
the truth, motherfucker

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,700
Scandalous know-it-all,
feedback chamber

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,200
Nobody wants the proof,
they want a number

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:53,500
We don't deny what is
wrong with our lives

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:06,400
We can't decide what is left of our
right to silence our remains

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,600
Buried in the back and
I'm sick and alive

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:17,300
Hollow as a breath, the
further you dive

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Oh, how I missed your honesty

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,550
You never miss with your intensity

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
You're gonna need a new disguise

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,700
Vessels burst, veins release

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Just slide into the nearest lie

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,700
(One, two, oh my god)

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,100
All the ligatures are getting
tight, like a style

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,500
Murder another mouth before the trial

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Scalpel and then you scalp
'em to fucking death

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,800
Kills for the other vampires
and surrogates

26
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,400
It's a ploy for attention and evidence

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,000
All your fucking monsters are
flaws in your common sense

28
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,700
Do the dance while the shovels
are breaking dirt

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,450
Everybody mind your fuckin'
business or you get hurt

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:14,300
We don't deny what is
wrong with our lives

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:27,200
We can't decide what is left of our
right to silence our remains

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,000
Buried in the back and
I'm sick and alive

33
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,450
Hollow as a breath, the
further you dive

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,100
Oh, how I missed your namaste

35
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,400
You never miss with your integrity

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,100
You're gonna need a new disguise

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,600
Vessels burst, veins release

38
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,100
Just slide into the nearest lie

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Read all about it if you want to know

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,100
(Everything is god online)

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
Read all about it if you want to know

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,100
(Everything is god online)

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Read all about it if you want to know

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,000
Stoned like a beast on
a chain lookin' dead

45
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,200
Feelin' strange, what the fuck

46
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm material to sew into the stains

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,400
Like a catalogue of pain, like
a martyr in restraints

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,800
I can kill with a will, and
it's stronger every day

49
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm a knife, I'm a gun,
I'm a slit, I'm a scar

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm a scream, I'm a death,
I'm a threat, I'm afraid

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,500
That you will never understand
I'm not the same

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,400
You better call the triple
9, I want a face

53
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,100
That you can only recognize

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm afraid, I'm afraid,
I'm afraid, I'm afraid

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:04,500
When everything is god
online, nothing is

56
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:17,800
When everything is god
online, nothing is

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:27,800
