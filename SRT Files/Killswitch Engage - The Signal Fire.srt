1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,100
No more following this endless maze

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,000
Separation will define the new way

3
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,600
What's broken is what
leads us all astray

4
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,600
The chosen are renewed in amnesty

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,900
Broken, hopeless, the state
of all our fates

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,900
Revolted, woken, lead
us from this place

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,200
Nowhere to hide, strength realigned

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,800
The signal fire's alight

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,400
Given to fight, there's
hope just in sight

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,000
The signal fire's alight

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,800
Can we walk a mile in another's shoes

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,200
To determine what we have
to lose? (To lose)

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,800
Disconnection of a common reality

14
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,400
Becomes so lost in this
world of hypocrisy

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,300
Nowhere to hide, strength realigned

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,900
The signal fire's alight

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Given to fight, there's
hope just in sight

18
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,500
The signal fire's alight

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,100
(Alight)

20
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,800
This is our one beacon
to deliver us all

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:10,700
To guide us away from this
decay of humanity

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Nowhere to hide, strength realigned

23
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,900
The signal fire's alight

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,100
Given to fight, there's
hope just in sight

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,350
The signal fire's alight

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
(Alight)

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,600
(Alight)

28
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,600
I won't give up this fight

29
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,400
(Alight)

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,000
The signal fire is alight

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
