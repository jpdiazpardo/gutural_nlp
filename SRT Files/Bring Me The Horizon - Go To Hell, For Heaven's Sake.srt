1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,500
For the love of god, will
you bite your tongue

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Before we make you swallow it

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,100
It's moments like this where
silence is golden

4
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,200
(And then you speak)

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,300
No one wants to hear you

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
No one wants to see you

7
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
So desperate and pathetic

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm begging you to spare me

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,900
The pleasure of your company

10
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,200
(When did the diamonds
leave your bones?)

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,700
I'm burning down every bridge we make

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,100
I'll watch you choke on
the hearts you break

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm leaving out every word you said

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,200
Go to hell for heaven's sake

15
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,600
I'm burning down every bridge we make

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,100
I'll watch you choke on
the hearts you break

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,500
I'm leaving out every word you said

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,000
Go to hell for heaven's sake

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,000
(Go to hell for heaven's sake)

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,750
No one wants to hear you
(save your breath)

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,700
No one wants to see you

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
So desperate and pathetic

23
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,500
You think that no one sees this

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,100
I think it's time you knew the truth

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,900
I'm burning down every bridge we make

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,300
I'll watch you choke on
the hearts you break

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm leaving out every word you said

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,300
Go to hell for heaven's sake

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,900
I'm burning down every bridge we make

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,300
I'll watch you choke on
the hearts you break

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
I'm leaving out every word you said

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,200
Go to hell for heaven's sake

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,800
When did the diamonds leave your bones

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,600
Leave your bones

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,100
You're not a shepherd,
you're just a sheep

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,400
I'll cut my depths of
everyone you meet

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,850
Your own flesh with no bones

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,400
Feed them to the sharks

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,000
And throw them to the walls

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,800
I'm burning down every bridge we make

41
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,300
I'll watch you choke on
the hearts you break

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm leaving out every word you said

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,200
Go to hell for heaven's sake

44
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,700
I'm burning down every bridge we make

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll watch you choke on
the hearts you break

46
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm leaving out every word you said

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,900
Go to hell for heaven's sake

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Go to to hell for heaven's sake

49
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,800
Go to to hell for heaven's sake

50
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,500
Go to to hell for heaven's sake

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:09,500
