1
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,700
Everyone that you love is dead

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,300
Unholy ghost of Crane's delirium

3
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,900
Trace the fear of your silhouette

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
You wanted madness…. Undead Ahead

5
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,700
Oh how the wind it whispers

6
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,500
The moonlit fog ignites

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,900
With Lucifer as witness

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The pumpkin rides tonight

9
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,700
Crimson coagulates

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,100
Severed head bouquet

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,100
Body incomplete

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Sealer of your fate

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,800
Crimson calligraphy

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,700
Written on the trees

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:47,900
Creature from the grave, Headless
and hellbent for me

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,100
Line the streets

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,300
Murder for keeps

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,200
That's how you play trick or
treat with a heart beat

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,200
Bloody does he, bloody does he
storm through the gate way

20
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,200
Race the sunset, head for the bridge

21
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,400
You cannot kill that which has
no soul or life to take

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,600
The blood of our beloved

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,100
The Hessian comes to claim

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
Crimson coagulates

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,100
Severed head bouquet

26
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,100
Body incomplete

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,800
Sealer of your fate

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Crimson calligraphy

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Written on the trees

30

Creature from the grave, Headless
and hellbent for me

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,100
The woods, the woods

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
The bridge of souls too far to reach

33
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,900
You can't escape

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,700
Damnation on all hallows eve

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,300
This place is haunted

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,100
The woods, the woods

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,100
The bridge of souls too far to reach

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,900
You can't escape

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Damnation on all hallows eve

40
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,400
Crimson coagulates

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,100
Severed head bouquet

42
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,100

Crimson calligraphy

45
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,700
Written on the trees

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,400
Creature from the grave, Headless
and hellbent for me

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,050
Live or die in the tale
of the midnight ride

48
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,200
Where reality and superstition collide

49
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,500
Close your eyes kiss your
dearest Katrina goodbye

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:16,600
And beware of the tale, tale
of the midnight ride

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,500
Revenge is cold and their
heads will roll

52
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,400
Menace in the moonlight

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:41,400
