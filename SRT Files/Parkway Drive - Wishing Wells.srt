1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,900
I spoke a vow today

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,200
And asked if god would come and play

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,900
I've dug a shallow hole
for him to sleep

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,200
But I swear he just won't answer me

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,900
I call on out is he afraid

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,600
I'll bury him down with
the ones he keeps

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,900
And if the devil's listening

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,500
I'll come for him as well

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,700
If I suspect he had a hand to play

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,000
And if I see his face in town

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,800
There's room for two down underground

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,200
Nothing's gonna stop me 'til I'm done

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,500
Until I'm done

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,000
Until I'm done

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,700
Until I'm done

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,900
Until I'm done

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,800
Because tonight I'm killing gods

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,500
Killing gods

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,000
It's guilt and frustration,
it's everything between

20
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,300
The silence and the absence
hitting home

21
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,500
Peripheral glances and the
chasing of a sound

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,000
I never knew I'd miss until it's gone

23
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,400
So ask me how I'm coping

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,300
And I'll smile and tell
you "I'm just fine"

25
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,400
While down inside I'm drowning
in the fucking rain

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,200
Because when everything is empty

27
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,600
And your heart is set to cave

28
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,300
Sometimes all you wish for

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,900
Is a place, is a place
to place the blame

30
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,800
Burn your heaven

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,500
Flood your hell

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,200
Drown you in your wishing wells

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,600
Burn your heaven

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,500
Flood your hell

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,450
Damn you all

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Because tonight I'm killing gods

37
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,150
The incendiary shock wave,
scorched earth policy

38
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,000
The devastation that only
loss will leave

39
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,800
The chants and incantations
of daily rituals

40
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,400
A subtle lapse in brutal honesty

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,900
So ask me how I'm coping

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,800
And I'll smile and tell
you "I'm just fine"

43
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,000
While down inside I'm screaming
'til I fucking bleed

44
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,600
Because when everyone's expendable

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,200
And your heart can't take the wait

46
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,800
The last thing that you wish for

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,100
Is the face, is the face
to face the pain

48
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,200
Burn your heaven

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Flood your hell

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Drown you in your wishing wells

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,900
Burn your heaven

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,700
Flood your hell

53
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,850
Damn you all

54
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,700
Because tonight I'm killing gods

55
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,800
I spoke a vow today

56
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,500
And asked if god would come and play

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,900
'Cause I just want to
cut that fucker down

58
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,000
Face me

59
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,600
Face me

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,900
Face me

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,900
Face me

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,300
Face me

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,800
Face me

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,100
None survive

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Face me

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,200
Face me

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
None survive

68
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,600
None survive

69
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,500
The devil and god have died inside me

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:10,500
