00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,800
One day there will be no more pain like an opiate wonderland

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,900
No more worry, it will all just end

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
And all our forward movement will finally cease

4
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,600
The human machine will finally bleed,

5
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,300
The human machine will finally cease to be

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
So set yourself free,

7
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,400
and disengage from reality

8
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,700
So set yourself free,

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,900
And disengage from reality

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,700
The grounds will shake and your children will tremble,

11
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,700
Soon enough the machine will fall

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,200
And we will all crumble,

13
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,400
The human machine will finally bleed and cease to be

14
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:58,700
We'll finally be set free, be set free, be set free

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,100
Just be glad you know what life is,

16
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,000
Be glad you know

17
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,900
You know what life is!

18
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,800
You know what life is!

19
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,700
One day there will be no worry,

20
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,600
No more pain, it will all just end

21
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,500
And all our forward movement will finally cease

22
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,400
Disengage

23
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,500
Disengage

24
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,700
Disengage

25
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,800
Disengage

26
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
Disengage

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,100
Disengage

28
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Disengage
