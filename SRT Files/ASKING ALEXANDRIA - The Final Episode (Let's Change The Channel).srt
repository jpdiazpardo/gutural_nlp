1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,400
Oh my God.

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh my God.

3
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,200
If only he knew,

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,300
If only he knew,

5
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,400
If only he knew about the world without
the bullshit and the lies,

6
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,300
We could've saved him.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
They could've saved me.

8
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,600
But instead I'm here drowning
in my own fucking mind,

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,300
And I'll be damned if you're
the death of me.

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,100
Blood and ink stain the walls.

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,700
Silently with bloodied
knuckles, I carry on

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,400
Hoping it's not too wrong.

13
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,100
You said the nights were far too long.

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,300
'Honey, it's just the start of it.'

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,200
Oh my God.

16
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,400
If only he knew.

17
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh my God.

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,500
If only he knew.

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
If only he knew!

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,000
If only he knew.

21
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,800
Just stand up and scream.

22
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,700
The tainted clock is counting down.

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,000
(Faster and fast!)

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,200
You gave in to me.

25
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,200
Would you say the nights
are far too long now?

26
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,300
(Faster, and faster and fast!)

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,700
(My God!)

28
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh my God!

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh my fucking God!

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The tears that stain my cheek
make me look weak!

31
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,900
I wear them proudly!

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
I wear them proud!

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,300
Just stand up and scream.

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,200
The tainted clock is counting down.

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,500
(Faster and fast!)

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,200
You gave in to me.

37
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,700
Would you say the nights
are far too long now?

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,800
(Faster, and faster and fast!)

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,600
Your knife,

40
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,400
My back!

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,300
My gun,

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Your head!

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,800
Your knife,

44
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,700
My back!

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
My gun,

46
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,200
Your head!

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,300
You need a doctor baby,

48
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,900
You scared?

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,700
You need a doctor baby,

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,100
You scared?

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,100
You need a doctor baby,

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,500
You scared?

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
You need a doctor baby,

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,500
You scared?

55
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,700
You scared,

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,200
You scared?

57
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,750
Yeah!

58
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,600
You need a doctor baby,

59
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,200
You scared?

60
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,100
You need a doctor baby,

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
You scared?

62
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,000
You need a doctor baby!

63
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,500
You need a doctor baby!

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,200
You scared?

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:36,200
