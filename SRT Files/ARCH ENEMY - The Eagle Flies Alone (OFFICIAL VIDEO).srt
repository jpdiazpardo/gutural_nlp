0
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,580
When I was born

1
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,220
the seed was sown.

2
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:06,680
I will not obey, my life is my own.

3
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,517
Battle those

4
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,597
who which to enslave me

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,440
Expose the lies

6
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,800
that enrage me

7
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:17,897
I don't believe in Heaven, I don't be believe in Hell

8
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:19,777
Never joined the herd

9
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,777
could not adjust well

10
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:22,657
slave, master,

11
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:23,777
it's not for me

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,360
I chose my own path

13
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,740
Set myself free.

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,600
I

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,480
I go my own way

16
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,600
I

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,040
Swim against the stream (forever)

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,040
I will fight the powers that be

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,100
I

20
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,800
I go my own way

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,720
I swim against the stream(forever)

22
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,700
I will fight the powers that be

23
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,400
The eagle flies alone

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,300
Riches in the system

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,200
But it takes the norm

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,500
This world is full of lies and deceit

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,100
I ask my own betrayal

28
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
Cut so deep

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
suffered defeat

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
Only to rise agains

31
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,860
I

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,600
I go my own way

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,160
I swim against the stream(forever)

34
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,100
I will fight the powers that be

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,820
I

36
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,440
I go my own way

37
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,520
I swim against the stream(forever)

38
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,680
I will fight the powers that be

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,960
The eagle flies alone

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,420
ALONE!!

41
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,200
I

42
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,780
I go my own way

43
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,120
I swim against the stream (forever)

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,440
I will fight the powers that be

45
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,220
I

46
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,200
I go my own way

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,920
I swim against the stream(forever)

48
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,080
I will fight the powers that be

49
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,620
The eagle flies alone
