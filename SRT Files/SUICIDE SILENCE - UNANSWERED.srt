00:00:06,60 --> 00:00:09,10
How much must I curse your name

1 - OK
00:00:09,10 --> 00:00:13,30
And put your beliefs to shame
Before you prove yourself

2 - OK
00:00:13,30 --> 00:00:22,10
And end this life?
End this life

3 - OK
00:00:24,20 --> 00:00:28,00
And I'll say a fucking prayer

4 - OK
00:00:28,00 --> 00:00:32,10
Because I know it won't be answered

5 - OK
00:00:32,10 --> 00:00:34,10
Where is your god?

6 - OK
00:00:34,10 --> 00:00:36,00
Where is your god?

7 - OK
00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:39,80
Where is your fucking god?

8 - OK
00:00:43,70 --> 00:00:54,90
And even though I don't believe in you.
I pray for the day.
I pray for the day.
That you end this life

9 - OK
00:00:55,90 --> 00:01:03,50
So please take me away

10 - OK
00:01:04,00 --> 00:01:08,90
I want the hand of god to come and strike me down

11 - OK
00:01:08,90 --> 00:01:14,30
I want the hand of god to come and strike me down.
Where is your god?

12 - OK
00:01:14,30 --> 00:01:16,40
Where is your god?

13 - OK
00:01:16,40 --> 00:01:20,20
Where is your fucking god?

14 - OK
00:01:20,20 --> 00:01:25,40
For all the prayers that go unanswered

15 - OK 
00:01:33,10 --> 00:01:37,00
For all the prayers that go unanswered

16 - OK
00:01:37,00 --> 00:01:40,50
Why do you think that is?

17 - OK
00:01:40,50 --> 00:01:44,90
For the families that waste their time

18 - OK
00:01:44,40 --> 00:01:54,50
Open your eyes and all your prayers will go unanswered

19 - OK
00:01:54,50 --> 00:01:58,50
Why do you think that is?

20 - OK
00:01:58,20 --> 00:02:02,90
For the families that waste their time

21 - OK
00:02:02,30 --> 00:02:06,90
Open your fucking eyes
