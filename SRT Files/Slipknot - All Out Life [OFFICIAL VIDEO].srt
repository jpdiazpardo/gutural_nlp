1
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,600
What a world, the horizon's

2
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,300
Coming like a hell-bent
killing machine

3
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,500
Can't afford to be the
goddamn wreckage

4
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,800
Burn it all again at a million degrees

5
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,700
Calling all the adamant upper-level

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,200
Undefeated counterfeit cunts
with a reason to fear

7
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Throw away all the meaningless
shit that's clinging

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,900
The enemy is here, I said stop

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Give it to three

10
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm gonna show you how to do
it if you know what I mean

11
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,100
One by one against, give me the name

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,300
All you shiny pretty never-
wills ruined the game

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,000
You hold all the keys, so the
chains shouldn't hold you

14
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,800
I know you heard me,
I fucking told you

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Old does not mean dead,
new does not mean best

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,200
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being
right about everything I've said

17
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,500
Yours does not mean mine,
kill does not mean die

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
We are not your kind

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,400
No excuses, I challenge you
to all out fucking life

20
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,800
Drop that shit and put
it on a pedestal

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,900
Children are afraid of the gods

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
Raise your hands and show
me what's impossible

23
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,650
That makes us even, never
tell me the odds

24
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,900
What a bore, I'm getting
stuck in a metaphor

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
I don't wanna go to sleep

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,200
I need a breakdown quick
in negotiations

27
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,800
Get it all together and remember
to seethe, stop

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,600
Give it to three

29
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm gonna show you how to do
it if you know what I mean

30
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,000
Drive by violence, more of the same

31
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,200
I can see where you're going,
and I'm really ashamed

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,900
Do you think when you act or just
act like you're thinking?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,900
I gotta know now, you better tell me

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Old does not mean dead,
new does not mean best

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,000
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being
right about everything I've said

36
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,500
Yours does not mean mine,
kill does not mean die

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
We are not your kind

38
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:08,600
I challenge you to all out life

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,600
We are gathered here today
to get it right

40
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,500
Repeat after me:

41
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
"I will not celebrate mediocrity

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,900
I will not worship empty shells

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,900
I will not listen to worthless noises

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,900
I will not subject myself to selected
predictable choices

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,600
My time, my attention

46
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,500
My quality should not
be bought and sold

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,500
For convenience's sake, ever"

48
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,400
We are not your kind

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,700
We are not your kind

50
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,900
We are not your kind

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,100
We are not your kind

52
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,300
We are not your kind

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
We are not your kind

54
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,800
We are not your kind

55
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,200
We are not your kind

56
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,000
Old does not mean dead,
new does not mean best

57
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,400
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being
right about everything I've said

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,800
Yours does not mean mine,
kill does not mean die

59
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,300
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while
'til I really feel alright

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,700
Old does not mean dead,
new does not mean best

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,200
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being
right about everything I've said

62
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,700
Yours does not mean mine,
kill does not mean die

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
We are not your kind

64
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,200
No excuses, I challenge you
to all out fucking life

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,400
All out life, yeah

66
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:39,900
I challenge you to all out
fucking life, yeah

67
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,900
Live, live, live, life

68
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:54,900
