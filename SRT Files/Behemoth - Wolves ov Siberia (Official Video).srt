1
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,900
Enthrone thyself, O Archuman

2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,800
O how thou shineth in the realm above

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
As planets rumble when thou
descended upon this globe

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,700
To walk this Earth like
a shimmering god

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,800
Let it be forever heard

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,100
We lost our Eden to own the world

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,500
Let it be forever know

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,950
We lost our battle to win the war

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,700
Come all ye, Wolves ov Siberia

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,500
We hail the flame, we hail the ice

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,300
Beyond bosom, beyond materia

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,700
We reject! We fucking deny!

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,800
Let it be forever heard

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,100
From Slave to king, from king to man

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
Let it be eternally know

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,400
We fled from heavens to rape the world

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:56,400
