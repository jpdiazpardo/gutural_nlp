The devil is dead.
I have never felt the way that I have, until I left the valley in flames.
Let it burn, let it die, blind the all-seeing eye, but I know smoke will never clear in hell

1 - OK
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:20,00
The smell of burning oak makes me sick.
Still, I breathe deep

2 - OK
00:01:20,60 --> 00:01:25,40
Still, I cross to the other side

3 - OK
00:01:25,40 --> 00:01:29,10
But I hear a voice behind me say

4 - OK
00:01:29,10 --> 00:01:37,10
I, the еye closed its final time as I had walkеd through the flames. Will

5 - OK
00:01:36,20 --> 00:01:43,80
Will, the will of a beast is nothing compared to the will of a god

6 - OK
00:01:43,30 --> 00:02:01,00
I'll find, I'll find my peace when the bones of the devil lay at my feet. 
You, you and I are one, mark my words, I will find you

7 - OK
00:02:03,00 --> 00:02:06,10
I will find you

8 - OK
00:02:11,80 --> 00:02:21,00
A beast will always smell the blood of a coward and a narrow-minded fool will always follow down the narrow path to the blade that can make a god bleed

9 - OK
00:02:22,50 --> 00:02:28,50
Still, you are weak.
You're just a boy with his mother's eyes

10 - OK
00:02:29,50 --> 00:02:36,80
That carries the weight of his father's heart

11 - OK
00:02:51,30 --> 00:02:57,40
I always feel like there's something that I've left behind

12 - OK
00:03:16,40 --> 00:03:21,50
It's me, it's me

13 - OK
00:04:08,60 --> 00:04:15,50
Until you realize who I am

14 - OK
00:04:34,90 --> 00:04:50,80 
I'll find my peace when the bones of the devil lay at my feet.
You, you and I are one, mark my words, I will find you!
