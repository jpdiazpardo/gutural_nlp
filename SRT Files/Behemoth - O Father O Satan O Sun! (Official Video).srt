Akephalos

2
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,200
Shine thru me

3
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,700
Come forth in war

4
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,500
Come forth in peace

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
Bring down the sun

6
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,350
Extinguish all the stars

7
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,300
Let me remain

8
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,800
In splendor ov thy light

9
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,900
Bornless One

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
As darkness bright

11
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,800
Found not in tongues

12
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,000
Found not in light

13
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,900
Bring down the rain

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,100
Drain waters ov Styx

15
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,400
Faustian luminary

16
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,600
Redeem

17
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,550
Blaspheme

18
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,200
Like a day without the dawn

19
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,000
Like a ray void ov the sun

20
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,400
Like a storm that brings no calm

21
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm most complete yet so undone

22
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,600
Agathos Daimon

23
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Ov plague and fever

24
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Thy name is nowhere

25
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,100
Thy name is never

26
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Liberate me

27
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,100
Ignite the seeds

28
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Bind not to guilt

29
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,850
Ignis Gehennalis

30
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,800
O Father

31
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
O Satan

32
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,700
O Sun

33
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,900
Let the children come to thee

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,100
Behold the morning star

35
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,500
Akephalos

36
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,900
Shine thru me

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,100
Come forth in war

38
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,000
Come forth in peace

39
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,600
Like a day without the dawn

40
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,300
Like a ray void ov the sun

41
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,800
Like a storm that brings no calm

42
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm most complete yet so undone

43
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:03,000
O Lion-Serpent Sun, The beast
that whirlest forth,

44
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,700
a thunder-bolt, begetter of life!

45
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Thou that flowest! Thou that goest!

46
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,600
Thou Satan-Sun, Hadith, that
goest without will!

47
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:27,100
Thou Air! Breath! Spirit! Thou
without bound or bond!

48
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Thou essence, air swift-
streaming, elasticity!

49
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,000
Thou wanderer, father of all!

50
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,000
Thou wanderer, spirit of all!

51
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,250
Hear me, and make all spirits
subjects unto me;

52
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,800
so that every spirit of the firmament
and of the ether,

53
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,400
upon the earth and under the earth,

54
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,000
on dry land and in the water

55
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,900
of whirling air, and of rushing fire,

56
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and every spell and scourge of god

57
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,400
may be obedient unto me.

58
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,200
Thou spiritual sun! Satan,
thou eye, thou lust!

59
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,000
Cry aloud! Cry aloud!

60
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:27,300
Whirl the wheel, O my Father,
O Satan, O Sun!

61
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:37,300
