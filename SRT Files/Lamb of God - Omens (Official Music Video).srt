1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,900
I cut the weight of connection
and lead myself astray

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,100
The end will justify the means, but
in the end it stays the same

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,800
There's nothing left at all,
nothing left to see

4
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,000
A restrictive empty exercise
within a hollow scheme

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,800
Do you see the…

6
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,400
Omens? Omens

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,800
Fuck it all, ignore the omens

8
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,300
Omens, omens

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,400
Fuck it all, ignore the omens

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,700
An endless recitation thrown right
through the looking glass

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:23,000
I’m trapped inside a parody,
a fabricatеd past

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,650
Searching for releasе from
all this rising stress

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,500
Charted past the point of curing
with a broken compass

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,500
Motes in the eye of God,
indulging Armageddon

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,200
The devil slits the muse's throat
and drinks her last confession

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,600
Do you see the…

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,500
Omens? Omens

18
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Fuck it all, ignore the omens

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Omens, omens

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,300
Fuck it all, ignore the omens

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,900
I've fallen out of touch
with who you think I am

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,600
I can’t pretend to care
or bother to condemn

23
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,300
All this rising apathy,
it's growing every day

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I can't pretend to care about
how this will end

25
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,300
All I see

26
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,300
Are omens, omens

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,700
Fuck it all, ignore the omens

28
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,900
I see omens, I hear omens

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,200
I say fuck it all, ignore the omens

30
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:39,200
