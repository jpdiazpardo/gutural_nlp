1
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Say something about awakening

2
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,300
The rebellion you felt before

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,700
Wake, change your course

4
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Laws will follow

5
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,550
Restart, reactivate the core

6
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,100
Rise

7
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
Yeah, you come out

8
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,200
You're awake now

9
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,500
Put your fist in the air

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,000
You were hiding

11
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,700
Now you throw yourself

12
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,400
Into the storm

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,950
Stand

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Gather your strength, raise your eyes

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,700
Fear not the demons you're up against

16
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,500
Now that you dove down

17
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,500
Found the bottom begging for air

18
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:32,400
How sad, how long it takes
us to rise and fight

19
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,700
Yeah, you come out

20
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,700
You're awake now

21
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,500
Put your fist in the air

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
You were hiding

23
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,400
Now you throw yourself

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,200
Into the storm

25
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Flames

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Dancing in the open

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:13,600
You step into the light

28
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:22,700
You step into the light

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,700
Now that you dove down

30
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,700
Found the bottom begging for air

31
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:44,000
How sad, how long it takes
us to rise and fight

32
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,900
Yeah, you come out

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're awake now

34
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,900
Put your fist in the air

35
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,900
You were hiding

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Now you throw yourself

37
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,700
Into the storm

38
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,700
Storm

39
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,100
Into the storm

40
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,300
Storm

41
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:30,300
