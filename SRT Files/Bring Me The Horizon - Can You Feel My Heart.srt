00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,700
Can you hear the silence?

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,900
Can you see the dark?

3
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,600
Can you fix the broken?

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,100
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,100
Can you help the hopeless?

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,500
Well, I'm begging on my knees

7
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Can you save my bastard soul?

8
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,150
Will you wait for me?

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,900
I'm sorry brothers

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,800
So sorry lover

11
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,700
Forgive me, father

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,300
I love you mother

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,100
Can you hear the silence?

14

Can you feel my heart?

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,800
Can you feel my heart?

19
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm scared to get close

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,400
And I hate being alone

21
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,200
I long for that feeling

22
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,200
To not feel at all

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,000
The higher I get

24
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,800
The lower I'll sink

25
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,600
I can't drown my demons

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
They know how to swim

27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm scared to get close

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,400
