1
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,800
Secrets whispered through
a veil of lies

2
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,800
When did I become this
person you despise?

3
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,400
Open my eyes

4
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,900
You've been in disguise

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,700
The door is closing

6
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,100
You're on the outside now

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
It's curtain call

8
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,100
After everything I did for you

9
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,400
This is what you choose
to put me through?

10
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,800
What happened to the
concept of loyalty?

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,200
I guess there really
is no more honesty!

12
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,400
Open my eyes

13
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,000
You've been in disguise

14
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,800
The door is closing

15
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,600
You're on the outside now

16
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,400
It's curtain

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,000
It's curtain call

18
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,400
Deceiver, deceiver

19
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,900
My head still spinning
from your Judas kiss

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,900
Deceiver, deceiver

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Not one thing about you I will miss

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,100
You put on a great act,
I'll give you that

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Go on and take a bow
you despicable rat

24
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,700
Accept the applause,
you king of whores

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,900
This is your grand finale

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Deceiver, deceiver

27
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,800
My head still spinning
from your Judas kiss

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,100
Imposter, I see you

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,300
Thou beest slain, tyrant,
show thy face!

30
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,100
Open my eyes

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,600
You've been in disguise

32
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,400
The door is closing

33
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,300
You're on the outside now

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,700
It's curtain call

35
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,500
It's curtain call

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,300
Deceiver, deceiver

37
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,700
I see... you!
