0 - OK
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:49,300
Haunted by the nature's fury
as the legend reads

1 - OK
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,600
You set off to search for a new
land as your master pleads

2 - OK
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:03,100
Wood and nails, they create
the masterpiece

3 - OK
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:11,100
The ark is gliding upon
the flooded surface

4 - OK
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,600
The wind is welcoming and
pushing it forward

5 - OK
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,600
The ark is on the tide, tide is high

6 - OK
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,800
Keep it safe and sound,
what you have inside

7 - OK
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,100
What is meant to be, let
it be (Let it be)

8 - OK
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,000
A blessing is a shield
in your time of need

9 - OK
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:52,600
The ark is gliding upon the ocean

10 - OK
00:01:52,700 --> 00:02:05,600
A placid giant on a mission.
The wholesome deed is transition

11 - OK
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,400
Of living creatures to the other side

12 - OK
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:20,000
To find a mountain the giant glides

13 - OK
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,600
Noah!

14 - OK
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,000
Something went wrong, huh?

15 - OK
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,000
I can hear the animals moaning

16 - OK
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,000
Dogs are howling in their roomless cage

17 - OK
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,250
Why are you standing frozen with fear?

18 - OK
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,150
Staying on the boat for weeks

19 - OK
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,900
Where the sea and the air are still

20 - OK
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,200
You sent a dove to find a seed

21 - OK
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,200
You sent a dove but it will not return

22 - OK
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,700
What is meant to be, let it be

23 - OK
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Keep it safe and sound,
what you have inside

24 - OK
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:42,600
The ark is imprisoned by the ocean

25 - OK
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:51,000
A placid giant failed the mission

26 - OK
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:59,600
Horizon bends over hiding dryland

27 - OK
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:08,400
The giant surrenders the
quest for a mountain

28 - OK
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,400
Skies are falling, Noah!

29 - OK
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,200
This woe just can't be gone

30 - OK
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,900
The horizon is bending over

31 - OK
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,900
And now it's upside down
