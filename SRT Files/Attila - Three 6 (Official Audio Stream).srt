1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,200
Yo, fuck what you heard, this Attila
back with that heavy shit

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,750
I am the Devil

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,350
If you're down with the
Devil say "Hell yeah"

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Hell yeah

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,400
Learn to forget it and look
ahead in the future again

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,100
If you're down with the
Devil say "Hell yeah"

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,100
Hell yeah

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,600
Sinning is winning, let's start
it from the beginning again

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,100
Don't forget the reason we're all
here: to live our best life

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,400
Don't judge me based on your collusion,
it's just a god-damn lie

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,550
When will you see through the bullshit,
opinions equal shit

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Let me see your three six

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,400
Go

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,900
If you feel it, fucking sing it

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,700
I'm burning down your church
like six six six

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,200
Can you smell the fire burning
like it's six six six?

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,600
Yah

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,100
If you're down with the
Devil say "Hell yeah"

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,100
Hell yeah

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,500
Learn to forget it and look
ahead in the future again

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,200
If you're down with the
Devil say "Hell yeah"

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,100
Hell yeah

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,700
Sinning is winning, let's start
it from the beginning again

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,600
I'm burning down your church
like six six six

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,000
Can you smell the fire burning
like it's six six six?

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,700

like six six six

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,500
Can you smell the fire burning
like it's six six six?

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,700
I am the Devil

29
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,100
Will you live a life of indulgence?

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,100
Will you sit back and watch
on the sidelines?

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,000
Everything is nothing but an illusion

32
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Stop judging us based
on your guidelines

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,100
Keep your opinions to yourself, bitch

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
Go live your life, I'll
live with my sins

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,000
Take a step back and see your delusion

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,500
You live a life based on
lies and confusion

37
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,000
If you feel it, let me hear it

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,500
I'm burning down your church
like six six six

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,900

like it's six six six?

I'm burning down your church
like six six six

41
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,650
Can you smell the fire burning
like it's six six six?

42
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,200
If you're down with the
Devil say "Hell yeah"

43
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,400
Hell yeah
