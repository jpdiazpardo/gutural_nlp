1
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,900
Ravaged are the heavens

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,750
Seven angels are deployed

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,600
The seals delivered

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,200
To return us to the void

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,200
And waiting on the cusp
of many dusks of man

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,200
He watches as the masses
seek a fake salvation

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,100
As He breeds annihilation

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,400
Now death is law

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,000
Venom dripping from the
mouth of madness

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,200
Incites the rites of war

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,700
Prepare the heights of Empire
for the agonising fall

12
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,400
The beast is rising

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,100
Enwreathed in flame

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,400
The soundtrack bleeds insanity

15
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,000
His theme, the screaming End Of Days

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,250
Come

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,500
Crawling King Chaos, come

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,300
Sing his name in rapture, wormwood
bitter, spat in tongues

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,700
Of ancient Pandemonia for the
ghosts all shall become

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,200
Returning to the churning
of primordial seas

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,300
The Order Of Disorder restored
through tribulation

22
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,700
Through this bred annihilation

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,350
The whole world is his church now

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,200
A seismic paradigm shift to chaos

25
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,450
Apophis

26
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,900
Reach dark office

27
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,850
Apophis

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Seize the Goddess

29
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,600
Apophis

30
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,000
Reach dark office

31
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,600
Apophis

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,800
Seize the Goddess

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,200
Apophis

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,400
Reach dark office

35
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,500
Apophis

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,800
Be the prophet's propaganda

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,800
The beast is rising

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,800
A cancer at the core

39
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,300
Of everything accelerating

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,500
To Death's apathetic maw

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,900
The beast is rising

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,550
Underlit by gore

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,900
Stone tablets crack, humanity

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is doomed to looming horror score

45
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,100
Scatter brittle insects, fate is heard

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
In the necrotic birth

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,000
Of the terminus plague

48
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,300
Satan has fallen

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,500
Midst dark waters of the Earth

50
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,100
Come

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Crawling King Chaos, come

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,400
Mountains heave great murmurs

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Fires raze the forests black

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,500
As billions flee the horsemen

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,100
Creation, wounded, staggers back

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,300
To expire in the mire, wiped
from all of time

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,100
It will be eternally that
we never existed

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,400
By this bred annihilation

59
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,850
Apophis

60
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,200
Reach dark office

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,350
Apophis

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,600
Seize the Goddess

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,700
Apophis

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Reach dark office

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Apophis

66
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,500
Seize the Goddess

67
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,700
Apophis

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,700
Reach dark office

69
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,000
Apophis

70
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,800
Be the prophet's propaganda

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,800
The beast has risen

72
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,100
Behind the sun

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,400
The least unleashed is Armageddon

74
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,800
For everything and everyone

75
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,400
The beast has risen

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,400
Tearing wide the door

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,800
For our burning footprint

78
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,100
On a cindered world, sinning no more

79
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,900
A cindered world, sinning no more

80
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:29,900
