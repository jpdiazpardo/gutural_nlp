1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,650
From crooked faith, the darkness flows

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,900
From hallowed halls, through
broken homes

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
To prey upon the weakest lamb

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,900
The cruelest heart is truly

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,300
Man

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,600
And when the judgment came,
they told us "turn away"

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,000
As their laughter whipped the
halls like cracking bones

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,500
Small words and hollow gestures,
the rats are closing ranks

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,300
They paint themselves as
angels, oh so wrong

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,900
Libera nos

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Libera nos

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,000
Deliver us from the blackest of mass

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,600
Libera nos

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,300
Libera nos

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,800
Deliver us justice for the lost

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,200
Straight down

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,500
I see their wings are burning

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,600
But it's a shallow fall

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,300
Straight down

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,000
I see their wings are burning

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,600
There are no halos to be found

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,550
So save your breath

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,700
Nothing here is sacred,
nothing is divine

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,200
If heaven's gates are open, then
I think I'll wait in line

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,600
Nothing here is holy when
every faith is blind

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,300
So save your breath, I don't
need more excuses

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
Libera nos

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,400
Libera nos

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,900
Deliver us from the blackest of mass

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Libera nos

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,300
Libera nos

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,150
Deliver us justice for the lost

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,800
But it's a shallow fall

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,200
It's a shallow fall

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
Straight down

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,600
I see their wings are burning

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,000
But it's a shallow fall

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,700
Straight down

39
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,500
I see their wings are burning

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,400
There are no halos to be found

41
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,200
I'll never see through
the eyes of your lord

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,500
But I have seen through
the eyes of a child

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,900
I'll never see through
the eyes of your lord

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,300
But I have seen through
the eyes of a child

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,900
I hope you rot

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Straight down

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,900
I see their wings are burning

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
But it's a shallow fall

49
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,700
Straight down

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,200
I see their wings are burning

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,600
There are no halos to be found

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,300
From crooked faith, the darkness flows

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,600
From hallowed halls, through
broken homes

54

Man
