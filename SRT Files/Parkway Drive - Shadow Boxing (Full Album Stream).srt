1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,100
Do you see me?

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,600
Do you see what I've become

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,900
I'm not the same beast

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,600
I leave a scar on all I touch

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,700
You think you know me now

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,500
Is it better than I know myself?

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,100
I know it hurts like hell

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,550
Admitting just how you've misjudged

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
All my life I've been
told the same old

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,900
Don't step out, don't test the mould

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,250
We know your kind, yeah we know you

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,100
So much better than you know yourself

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,900
See, the ones that won't engage me

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
Are the same trying to cage me

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,600
But I can't sit still
and I won't be tame
When the lights go out
Better know your enemy

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,200
spent a lifetime shadowboxing with death

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,200
And we'll dance with the devil
'til there's no songs left

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,200
So do you see me

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,300
Do you see what I've become

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm not the same beast, no

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,700
I leave a scar on all I touch

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,450
You think you know me now

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Is it better than I know myself

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,100
I know it hurts like hell

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,450
Admitting just how you've misjudged

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,100
You don't know me, you cannot own me

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,600
The path I'm on don't fit the old me,
I bear my soul as I keep evolving

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,200
And I chase this taste for blood

32
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,100
See, I learned real young,
don't seek no gold

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,800
Trust no fool and you won't get sold

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,700
I never feared the dark

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,500
No, I just became it

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
When the lights go dead

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,800
You better pray you're safe kid

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,200
Because I've spent a lifetime
shadowboxing with death

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,500
And we'll dance with the devil
'til there's no songs left

40
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,300
I try

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,300
To keep my cool and not
let this hate win

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,300
I find

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,700
This mask I wear can't
keep the darkness in

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,300
The world you know was born to fade

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,200
We'll dance upon its grave

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,600
You don't know me, you cannot hold me

47
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,400
You should have guessed that
you can't control me

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,600
I raise my soul like a private army
and I steel myself for war

49
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,600
Because I leaned real young,
when you walk through hell

50
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,300
The devil can't buy what
you won't sell

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
So I took my fear, reshaped and aimed

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,450
Because when the night caves in

53
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,000
No one will save you

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,350
So we'll dance with the devil
'til there's no songs left

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,500
I try

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
To keep my cool and not
let this hate win

57
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,600
I find

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,700
This mask I wear can't
keep the darkness in

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,100
This mask I wear can't
keep the darkness in

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:55,100
