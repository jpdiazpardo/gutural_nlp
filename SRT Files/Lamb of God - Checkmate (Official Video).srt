2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,200
The screeching halt machine
digging heels in disbelief

4
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,900
A bait-and-switch routine

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,700
Double-takes and double-speak

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
Still scripting the façade

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,700
Asphyxiate and choke the truth

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,250
All hail the money god

9
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,800
Repeat, echo, refrain

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,300
It's all the same

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
So deafening

12
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,800
Repeat, echo, refrain

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,200
A consequence

14
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,200
We asked for this

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,000
Repeat, echo, refrain

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,100
No, never again

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,600
The American scream

18
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,700
A coup d'état on full display,
a liar's sick charade

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,700
A traitor's grand parade

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,100
Narcissistic masquerades
for those without a say

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,700
Systematic disarray

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,600
Divide and conquer and close them in

23
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,900
And bury secrets deep

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,900
Make America hate again

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,700
And bleed the sheep to sleep

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,900
Repeat, echo, refrain

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,800
It's all the same

28
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,200
So deafening

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,100
Repeat, echo, refrain

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
A consequence

31
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,200
We asked for this

32
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,200
Repeat, echo, refrain

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,300
No, never again

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,100
The American scream

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,300
You try to pick the lesser of

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,200
But evil doesn't come in twos

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Bellicose and balkanized

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
A sinking ship of fools

39
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,200
So kiss the hangman as you drop

40
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,000
The rotting corpse of decency

41
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:24,300
Just another casualty of
the American scream

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Scream

43
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Repeat, echo, refrain

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,100
It's all the same

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
So deafening

46
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,800
Repeat, echo, refrain

47
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,000
A consequence

48
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,600
We asked for this

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Repeat, echo, refrain

50
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,450
No, never again

51
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,000
The American scream

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,200
Never again

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:24,200
