1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Did you never give a damn
in the first place

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,400
Maybe it's time you had
the tables turned

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,000
'Cause in the interest of all involved,
I got the problem solved

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,200
And the verdict is guilty…

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,900
Man nearly killed me

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,900
Steppin' where you fear to tread

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Stop, drop and roll - you were
dead from the git-go!

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,400
Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,300
Are you scared of me now? Then
you're dumber than I thought

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Always is, and never was

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,900
Foundation made of piss and vinegar

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,100
Step to me, I'll smear ya - think
I fear you? Bullshit!

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Just another dumb punk
chompin' at this tit

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,900
Is there any way to break
through the noise?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
Was it something that I said
that got you bent?

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,200
Gotta be that way if you want it

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,700
Sanity, literal profanity - hit me!

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,500
Spit it out

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,300
All you wanna do is drag me down

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,700
All I wanna do is stamp you out

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
Spit it out

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,300
All you wanna do is drag me down

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,200
All I wanna do is stamp you out

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,900
Maybe it's the way you gotta spread
a lot of rumor fodder

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
Keepin' all your little spies
and leavin' when you realize

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,300
Step up, fairy

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,800
I guess it's time to bury your ass with
the chrome straight to the dome

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,300
You heard me right, bitch,
I didn't stutter

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,100
And if you know what's good just
shut up and beg, brother

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,500
Backstab - don't you know
who you're dissin'?

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,300
Sideswipe - we know the ass
that you're kissin'!

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,900
Biggity-biggidy bitch
boy, halfway houser

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
Don't hear shit 'cause I
keeps gettin' louder

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,300
Come up and you get a
face full o' tactic

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,300
Lippin' off hard, goin'
home in a basket

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,700
You got no pull, no power, no nothin'

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
Now you start shit? Well
ain't that somethin'?

38
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Payoffs don't protect, and
you can hide if you want

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,000
But I'll find you - comin'
up behind you!

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500
Spit it out

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,400
All you wanna do is drag me down

42
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
All I wanna do is stamp you out

43
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Spit it out

44
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,300
All you wanna do is drag me down

45
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,600
All I wanna do is stamp you out

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
'Bout time I set this record straight

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,200
All the needlenose punchin'
is makin' me irate

48
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,100
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin'
on deaf ears

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Where you gonna be in
the next five years?

50
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,600
The crew and all the fools
and all the politics

51
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,500
Get your lips ready, gonna
gag, gonna make you sick

52
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
You got dick when they passed
out the good stuff

53
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,300
Bam - are you sick of me?

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,200
Good enough - had enough

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,000
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,700
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,900
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!

63
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,000
Spit it out

64
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,700
All you wanna do is drag me down

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,900
All I wanna do is stamp you out

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
