1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,900
Get up, get up!

2
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,500
Fuck!

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,600
Get out, never get out, never
get out, never let go,
never let go, never go

4
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,300
The spiraling inside my own disguise

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,600
"This is my design"

6
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,200
But we're not here together

7
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,500
Mirror, mirror, tell me who you see

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,700
Am I you or me?

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,450
I can never remember

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,950
But you can't hide forever

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,200
I found myself by losing hope

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,800
I lost my way to find a home

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,300
I hid myself to stay alive

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,800
Now I'm ready to face my disguise

15
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:29,000
Get out, never get out, never
get out, never let go,
never let go, never go

16
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,800
I am locked within the box I built

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
From the inside out

18
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,200
Reassured by my doubt I (no)

19
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,600
I don't want this fucking (no)
codependent vice (no)

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,000
But desperate measures call
for desperate lies

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,800
Desperate lies!

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,000
I found myself by losing hope

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,500
I lost my way to find a home

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,000
I hid myself to stay alive

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,500
Now I'm ready to face my disguise

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
Sick of wearing a mask

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,000
Sick of hiding my face

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,700
Sick of every motherfucker
that is in my way

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,900
Sick of digging for answers

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,100
While you bury the truth

31
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,600
Fuck your method to my sadness,

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,000
I will bury you

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
Dig!

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Dig!

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,700
I will not become a figure
of my mistakes

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
I will not become the mask,
fear is not my fate

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,700
You can't turn down anger,
you can't silence pain

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,600
You will not put out the
fire that burns in me

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,000
That burns in me!

40
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,300
I sold my soul to my disguise

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,300
I hid myself to stay alive

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I found myself by losing hope

43
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,000
I lost my way to find a home

44
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,400
I hid myself to spite my eyes

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,400
I was losing myself in my disguise

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,000
Fear I follow

47
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,500
Safe in sorrow

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Time I borrowed

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm ready to face my disguise

50
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:48,200
Get out, never get out, never
get out, never let go,
never let go, never go

51
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:57,800
Get out, never get out, never
get out, never let go,
never let go, never go

52
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:07,800
