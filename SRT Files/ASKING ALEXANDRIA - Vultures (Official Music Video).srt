1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,400
Close the curtains, cash me in

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,900
Gather photographs of
the Devil you let in

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,900
Digging deep inside my soul

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,200
I don't know, I don't know

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,300
Where to turn

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,700
Everywhere I look these vultures burn

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,500
The life right outta me

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,500
Do I run or lay down and die?

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:58,900
Is it time to close my eyes?

10
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,600
Keep me numb, I'll follow direction

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,050
A pawn to pass around and
be bled until I'm dry

12
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,900
It's hard to see what's underneath

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,650
Is it me? Is it me?

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,200
Where do I turn?

15
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,800
Everywhere I look these vultures burn

16
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,000
The life right outta me

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,700
Do I run or lay down and die?

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,500
Is it time to close my eyes?

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,900
For so long all I've known,
all I've seen's

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Green lights. Fuck your greed,
all I need's somewhere

21
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,700
To catch my breath, rest my
head and ease my mind

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,200
I've been holding on

23
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,000
But my grip ain't what it used to be

24
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,100
I'm much older, I'm bitter,
I'm jaded, I'm lost

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,500
Can somebody give me a sign?

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,400
Where do I turn?

27
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,700
Everywhere I look these vultures burn

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,900
The life right outta me

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Do I run or lay down and die?

30
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,100
Is it time to close my eyes?

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Where do I turn?

32
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,200
Everywhere I look these vultures burn

33
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,400
The life right outta me

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,350
Do I run or lay down and die?

35
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,100
Is it time to close my eyes?

36
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:34,100
