00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,700
You answer to me

2
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,650
I am the thunder and the rain

3
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,200
The confusion and the pain

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:02,100
and when I leave I will
wash your wounds clean and leave them golden

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,100
I got the whole world swingin'
from the end of my chain

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,100
and I'm calling

8
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,400
I got your life in my hands and
every debt will be paid

9
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,200
and I'm calling

10
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,900
spark and the ember

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,600
You are smoke threading the wind

12
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,300
In time

13
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,900
All will return to me

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,700
In time

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All find an end

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,500
You answer to me

17
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,800
I am the fight and the fury

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,700
Gravity in all its glory

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,100
and when I come around I
bring the hammer of god

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Down upon you

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,600
I got the whole world swingin'
from the end of my chain

22
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,400
and I'm calling

23
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,900
I got your life in my hands and
every debt will be paid

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,700
and I'm calling

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,200
Stop

26
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,100
Between the spark and the ember

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,500
You are smoke threading the wind

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,300
In time

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,800
All will return to me

30
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,600
In time

31
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
All find an end

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,300
In time

33
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
All will return to me

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,000
In time

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,900
You'll find no other way

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You answer to me

37
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,400
I am the end

38
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,100
and the beginning

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
I am the end

40
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,300
and the beginning

41
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,700
I am forever

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,200
I am eternal and nothing
stands against me

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,300
You answer to me

44
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,400
You answer to me

45
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,800
You answer to me

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:34,800
