1
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,450
Before the wall is caved, our temple

2
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,600
Pressed upon the face of england
we were suffering

3
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,900
To nothing less than the matter
of a socialist test raid

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,100
Dagger in the peace wicked
time disdained

5
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,400
Then empires saw much more to gain

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,900
The crown discounts are lost

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,400
Like a knot, count the cost

8
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,000
These numbers felt like water

9
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,400
The death and dying on
route to slaughter

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,200
Valen-times we've spined entwined

11
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,400
I am sorry that i left you here

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,500
In time i will find, the puppet
from the other side

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,100
So keep a candle burning in your
heart that is my shrine

14
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,600
Spilling tears fill a laboratory

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,600
Love's not responding beyond the pyre

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,750
The portent is promissory

17
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,900
Prevalence of this Seance in obeisance

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,350
To the spirits before Death's victory

19
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,900
The crown discounts are lost

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,300
Like a knot, count the cost

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,100
These numbers felt like water

22
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,100
The death and dying on
route to slaughter

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,500
Valen-times we've spined entwined

24
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,400
I am sorry that i left you here

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,500
In time i will find, the puppet
from the other side

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,000
So please accept my kisses through
the whispers of the winter morn'

27
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,500
I suffer alone

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,200
So far from home watching
you from a distance

29
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,700
A shadow persistent to mourn

30
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,600
No time to atone, you vow a renown

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,600
Beautifully craven you cut the black
raven who's tower has flown

32
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,700
Spilling tears fill a laboratory

33
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,300
Love's not responding beyond the pyre

34
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,700
The portent is promissory

35
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Prevalence of this Seance in obeisance

36
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,900
To the spirits before Death's victory

37
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,400
Winter seems far colder

38
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Without you by my shoulder
now this year

39
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:26,500
