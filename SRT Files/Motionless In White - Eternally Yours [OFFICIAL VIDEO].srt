1
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,300
Blow the bridge to the past

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,800
Wipe the fingerprints

3
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,300
Melt your heart encased in wax

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,600
Steal it with a kiss

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,000
Our fate engraved

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,400
Scar enslaved

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,650
As we mutually destruct

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:53,950
Repose, my love, I've sinned
enough for the both of us

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,900
I'm ready to bury all of my bones

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,800
I'm ready to lie but say I won't

11
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,500
So tell me your secrets

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
And join me in pieces

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,200
To rot in this garden made of stones

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:23,600
Eternally yours

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,800
I feed like you taught me
and selflessly swallow

16
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,900
We coalesce in darkness,
so selfishly hollow

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,600
Examine the wreckage

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,800
Writhing in tempo

19
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,500
Invisible anguish casting a shadow

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm ready to bury all of my bones

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm ready to lie but say I won't

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,000
So tell me your secrets

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,650
And join me in pieces

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,800
To rot in this garden made of stones

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,500
Eternally yours

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,000
As we rest in pieces, though
I know not your name

27
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,900
I would suffer forever to
absolve all your pain

28
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,050
And in the name of love

29
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,900
I'm ready to bury all of my bones

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm ready to lie but say I won't

31
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,600
So tell me your secrets

32
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,200
And join me in pieces

33
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,300
To rot in this garden made of stones

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm ready to bleed to make amends

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,200
And sleep in this dirt we call our bed

36
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,700
So tell me your secrets

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,400
And join me in pieces

38
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
To fall and rewrite the bitter end

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Eternally yours

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:55,400
