1
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,600
I keep on losing the keys

2
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,800
From reality

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,200
And now I'm passing on the wheel

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
To insanity.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
In a secluded corner

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,200
Waiting for my time to come

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,300
Waiting for the bedlam

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,300
To be pacified

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,400
I am climbing hand over fist

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,300
And I scratch concrete

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,000
Shine in the end My mistake

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,500
It's not there

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,500
The air is terribly heavy here

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
It settles inside

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,000
And I suffer burn after burn

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:21,700
From the dark. Burn

17
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,800
In a pit of consciousness

18
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,900
Squeal is bleeding

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,800
So I feel there was someone else

20
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,300
Before me.

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,300
Eyes are changing colors

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,000
A stranger knocks on my mind

23
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,200
I became a foreigner

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,600
To myself!

25
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:01,600
Myself!

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Stillness stuns. Wish I'd run

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,000
Creeped away to the light

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,300
In my head someone else

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,750
Setting snares

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,200
For my soul

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,900
In the darkest place

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,350
What was once named consciousness

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm a miniature

34
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:58,100
I'm a sketch forfeiting outlines

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,150
Irrelevant entity to sanity

36
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,400
A hive for nonsense

37
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,300
For multiple selves

38
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Resonating, but never compromising

39
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,500
Stillness stuns. Wish I'd run

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,300
Creeped away to the light

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,300
In my head someone else

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,000
Setting snares

43
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,400
For my soul

44
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,000
For my soul

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
