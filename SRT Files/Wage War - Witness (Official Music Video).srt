1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,300
I buried the judgment

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,300
I covered my tracks

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,100
Soon to be forgotten

4
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,400
There's a new life ahead

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,100
It was my hope that was fading

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,500
I was caught in a trap

7
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,300
It's the burden of failure

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,600
I carried on my back

9
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,500
Let's get this straight

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,700
A lot has changed in the last year

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,500
Thought I had everything together

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,700
But watched it all disappear

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,900
I put my faith in the wrong things

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,700
When I woke up, it was
gone, I gave up on me

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,300
Didn't even recognize myself

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,800
Self worth is not found
in someone else

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,900
Chase what you want, never give up

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,800
Salt the wound, all ties are cut

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,700
Now I see

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,900
I was broken to be made a better me

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,550
Had to learn to let it
go and let it be

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,300
Sometimes we're too blind to see

23
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,000
The hardest lessons that we learn

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,400
Are the ones where knowledge
must be earned

25
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,100
It's what makes us human

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,300
It's what gets us through it

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Weighed down by the pressures
of saving face

28
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,500
This is a dark world,
I'll be your witness

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,900
Witness

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,200
Now I see

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,400
I was broken to be made a better me

32
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,100
Had to learn to let it
go and let it be

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,900
Sometimes we're too blind to see

34
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,600
Learn to let it go and let it be

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,900
Learn to let it go and let it be

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,900
Learn to let it go and let it be

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,500
Learn to let it go

38
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:47,500
