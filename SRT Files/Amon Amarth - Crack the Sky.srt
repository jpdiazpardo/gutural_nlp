1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,300
Out of Asgård's gates

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,200
A chariot of gold

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,000
Pulled along the way

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,200
By Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjost

5
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,600
Crackling thunder roars

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,800
All across the world

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
As he rides to war

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,600
The champion of Midgård

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,500
Thor!

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,300
Let your hammer fly

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,300
Let the lightning crack
the blackened skies

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,200
Thor!

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,100
Let your hammer fly

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,100
Let the lightning crack
the blackened skies

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,100
Thor!

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,900
Let your hammer fly

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,800
Let the lightning crack
the blackened skies

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,800
Thor!

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,800
Let your hammer fly

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,400
Let the lightning crack
the blackened skies

21
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,000
Travelling 'round the horn

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,200
These mates of battery

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,000
To a land forlorn

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,100
Thor and hammer Mjölner

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Let your hammer fly

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,900
Let it fly

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Crack the blackened sky

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,900
Crack the sky

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,900
Let your hammer fly

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,700
Let it fly

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Crack the blackened sky

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,400
Crack the sky

33
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,400
Besieged by countless foes

34
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,400
His eyes they are aglow

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,300
Longing for the fight

36
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,000
He stands upon a mound

37
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,200
Doesn't aim the throw

38
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,200
Just lets the hammer fly

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,200
Thor!

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,000
Let your hammer fly

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,500
Let the lightning crack
the blackened skies

42
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,900
Thor!

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Let your hammer fly

44
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,200
Let the lightning crack
the blackened skies

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,700
Thor!

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Let your hammer fly

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,000
Let the lightning crack
the blackened skies

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,500
Thor!

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,400
Let your hammer fly

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Let the lightning crack
the fucking skies

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:48,500
