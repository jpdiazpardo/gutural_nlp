1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,600
Don't keep on telling me that
I'm gonna pull through

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,000
When you don't know low like I do

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,500
I'm afraid of the things I don't say

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,700
The thoughts in my head that keep
me tossing, turning, lying awake

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,200
Don't keep on telling me that
I'm gonna pull through

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,150
When you don't know low like I do

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,500
I've been running away again

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,700
I've been running away again

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,300
I've been running away again

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
Chasing after all the battles
I can never win

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,400
I don't think that I can
take much more it

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,200
It feels like I've lost
it all (Lost it all)

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:23,600
Who will save me when
I can't save myself?

14
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,400
Hard to think we were born
to live this way

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,800
Burning bridges, ripping stitches
out to drown the pain

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,500
Bleed me out, run me dry,
watch the hammer fall

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Let the river run and bury
me beneath it all

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,700
Bury me

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,100
Bury me beneath it all

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,700
I've been running away again

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Chasing after all the battles
I can never win

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,800
I don't think that I can
take much more it

23
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,500
It feels like I've lost
it all (Lost it all)

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,900
Who will save me when
I can't save myself?

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Searching for answers

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
A cure for this cancer

27
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,500
It's all in my head

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,100
I'm one step from the edge

29
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,500
I've been running away again

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,100
Chasing after all the battles
I can never win

31

I don't think that I can
take much more it

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,700
It feels like I've lost it all

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,100
I've been running away again

34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,100
Chasing after all the battles
I can never win

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
I don't think that I can

36
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,000
It feels like I've lost
it all (Lost it all)

37
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:23,300
Who will save me when
I can't save myself?

38
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:31,800
Who will save me when
I can't save myself?

Who will save me when
I can't save myself?
