1
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,700
I got an axe to grind, a crooked mind

2
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,600
You better watch your back

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,900
I got an axe to grind, a crooked mind

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,700
You better watch your back

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,700
Starved like a vampire chasing a vein

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,300
Cruel disposition, sickness I crave

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,900
Attention, attention,
welcome to the stage

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Your new sacrifice, come
sharpen your teeth

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,100
Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Prey, we are all prey for
the sorrow, our sorrow

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,000
Prey, prey, we're prey for the sorrow

12
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:32,300
Prey, prey, prey for the sorrow

13
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,600
I got an axe to grind, a crooked mind

14
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,500
You better watch your back

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,900
I got an axe to grind, a crooked mind

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,700
You better watch your back

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Sick validation, gut full of pills

18
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,200
Self-medication, it's making me ill

19
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,800
Attention, attention,
it's all eyes on me

20
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,600
I'll burn at the stake while
you ache for the kill

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,000
Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,700
Prey, we are all prey for
the sorrow, our sorrow

23
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:35,950
Prey for the sorrow, (our sorrow)

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Prey, prey, we're prey for the sorrow

25
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,900
Prey, prey, prey for the sorrow

26
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,700
Our new gods are empty like
the holes in our heads

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
We dance upon the alter
of envy and hubris

28
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,900
A scourge of narcissism reaps
depression in black waves

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,800
If this is your salvation,
you better pray

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
You better pray

31
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,000
You better pray

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,700
One, two, three, go

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Prey, we are all prey for the sorrow

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:01,900
Prey, we are all prey for
the sorrow, our sorrow

35
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,900
Prey, prey, we're prey for the sorrow

36
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Prey, prey, prey for the sorrow

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:25,800
