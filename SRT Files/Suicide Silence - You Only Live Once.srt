0 - OK
00:00:04,90 --> 00:00:12,00
Push your care, push your burdens aside, 
erase everything inside and leave just one thing on your mind

1 - OK
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:18,60
You only live once so just go fucking nuts, go!

2 - OK
00:00:23,90 --> 00:00:28,10
Live life hard

3 - OK
00:00:30,40 --> 00:00:37,30
You only get one shot, so shoot! With every breath you take, you're dying

4 - OK 
00:00:37,20 --> 00:00:45,30 
With every step we take, we're falling apart,
if we only had one chance, we'd breathe

5 - OK
00:00:45,00 --> 00:00:51,00
Let's take the chance right now and scream

6 - OK
00:00:51,10 --> 00:00:55,10
You only live one life

7 - OK 
00:00:55,00 --> 00:01:04,30
For a very short time, so make every second divine. Go!

8 - OK
00:01:10,20 --> 00:01:18,35
Live life hard, live life hard

9 - OK
00:01:18,20 --> 00:01:28,10
Are you still breathing? It's your heart that's beating inside
That keeps us alive and for the very first time

10 - OK
00:01:28,00 --> 00:01:36,40
We're pushing aside to surrender, everything that I see in my eyes

11 - OK
00:01:37,10 --> 00:01:44,35
Except for the one thing on my mind, that I am alive

12 - OK
00:01:44,00 --> 00:01:52,19
For the very first time, for the first time

13 - OK
00:01:52,00 --> 00:01:56,50
Pushing worry aside

14 - OK
00:01:56,50 --> 00:02:00,10
For the first time

15 - OK
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:03,00
Pushing worry aside

16 - OK
00:02:21,90 --> 00:02:25,45
Erase everything inside

17 - OK
00:02:26,10 --> 00:02:29,60
Erase everything inside

18 - OK
00:02:53,00 --> 00:03:09,70
Live life hard, live life hard, live life hard, live life hard
