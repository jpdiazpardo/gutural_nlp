1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,900
One, two, three, four (all
the things that she said,
was it all in my head?)

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,400
Come on, baby

3
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,300
Keep it down

4
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Honey, hush your lips

5
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,800
Clothes trailing

6
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,400
From the backdoor

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,900
To the bedroom

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,700
And I don't even know your name

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,500
Give me all you've got

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,400
Make this night worth my time

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,000
Make this worth my time (oh)

12
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,600
What I would give to live
this night again

13
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,800
I knew when I first saw you

14
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,000
You'd fuck like a whore

15
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,900
You'd fuck like a whore

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,600
I can hear you screaming
for more (yeah)

17
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,700
Your thighs were made
for cheeks to graze

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,100
My lips, your poison

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
They bring you to your knees

20
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,100
Your thighs were made
for cheeks to graze

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,150
My lips, your poison

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,500
They bring you to your knees

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,100
Ah, come on

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,650
Girl, get down

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,900
It's almost over

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,350
Take it all the way

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Oh

28
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:54,200
You stupid fucking whore

29
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,000
And after all of all my dreaming
being only you

30
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,200
You're standing there, baby, oh

31
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,000
The things that I could do

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Back to the wall with
a drink in my hand

33
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,400
Back it up, baby, ride, ride, ride

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,550
One step too late

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,800
And I never told you

36
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,550
That I can't take

37
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,800
Another disappointment

38
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:12,400
Breathing and grasping all leads
to another messy ending

39
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:26,400
Breathing and grasping all leads
to another messy ending

40
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,700
Ten inch

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:44,200
With your back against the wall

42
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:51,650
With your face buried in the pillow

43
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,400
I see you cold

44
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,000
I feel you heartless

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
Bitch

46
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,900
You stupid fucking bitch

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,800
You stupid fucking bitch

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,300
Fucking bitch

49
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:25,300
